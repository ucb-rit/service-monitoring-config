########################################################################
# Commands that use the NRPE system on the client host(s), to monitor
# the status of resources or other conditions on that host by running
# plugin code on the host itself.
#
# The following commands require that:
# * Nagios, NRPE (Nagios Remote Plugin Executor), the Nagios plugins
#   package, and appropriate individual Nagios plugins (e.g. check_disk)
#   are installed on the client host.
# * NRPE has been configured, as needed, in $NAGIOS_HOME/nrpe.cfg
# * The NRPE daemon is actively running on the client host, having been
#   launched via xinetd (preferred) or inetd (both with TCP Wrapper
#   support either built-in, as it often is in xinetd, or configured
#   for this service), or directly via chkconfig (deprecated).
# * The client host has been configured to grant access to one or more
#   monitoring server(s) running Nagios. This is typically done in
#   both the client's xinetd config (or, for inetd, in a TCP Wrapper
#   access control rule), and in its host firewall rules.

# -------------------
# Run Plugin via NRPE 
# -------------------

# Runs a plugin command via NRPE (Nagios Remote Plugin Executor) on the
# client host, specified by a service object's check_command of the form
# 'check_nrpe!some_command_name_here', where the part after the '!' sign, e.g.
# 'some_command_name_here', is sent to the check_nrpe plugin as $ARG1$, below.
#
# Any plugin commands to be run must first be configured on each client host,
# in $NAGIOS_HOME/nrpe.cfg
#
# This configuration includes the command's name, the Nagios plugin it will
# run, and the arguments to be sent to that plugin, such as under what
# circumstances a warning or critical status should be generated, etc.
# The available plugin commands and their individual configuration can
# thus vary between hosts, although there are management advantages to
# standardizing on these across hosts to the maximum extent possible.
#
# By default, as noted above, the client host controls its own
# configuration for each plugin, which is regarded as relatively more secure.
# If you wish to override that default and enable the monitoring server to
# send that configuration to the client instead, in $ARG2$...$ARGn$ arguments,
# set 'dont_blame_nrpe=0' in $NAGIOS_HOME/nrpe.cfg on the client host.
# Doing so is *not* recommended, however, as it introduces potential
# command injection vulnerabilities; for instance:
# http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Apr/242
#
# This NRPE mechanism is typically used to check resources - free disk space,
# load average, et al. - on the client host. However, there are a large
# number of plugins that, if installed on the client, can be executed there
# via NRPE.
